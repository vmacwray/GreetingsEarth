# GreetingsEarth
Hellooooo, you sweet little underdeveloped alien beings!  Fear not, we come in peace.

Please do not misconstrue our intentions.  

We cannot eat you; it is biologically impossible for us to process your Earth proteins.

We do not want to take over your planet.  There is only the tiny crew of our ship & it took us 800 Earth years to get here.

Our only desire is to trade for a little bit of space so we can set up and launch our new sub-etheric reality show, "Living With Ape Descendants."

Auditions start Saturday.  Please arrive at L2 by 9 am UTC.  Bring a short camera-interview-style monologue.

Production and support staff positions will be posted shortly.
